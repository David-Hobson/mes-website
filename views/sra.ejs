            <hr class="hr-primary">
            <p>The Student Representative Assembly (SRA) is the governing body of the McMaster Students Union (MSU).  The role of the SRA is to present and address the concerns of all full-time undergraduate students, work to provide the best possible MSU services and departments, and lobby the university so to improve the quality of being a McMaster student.  The assembly is composed of 31 undergraduate students who are voted by students to represent each academic faculty.  The SRA is also composed of four students voted by the SRA to perform as the Board of Directors (BOD), filling the roles of VP Finance, VP Education and VP Admin.</p>

            <p></p>
            <p>There are six students that represent the Faculty of Engineering, with the collective goal of accurately representing the engineering student voice to the university and the MSU, while simultaneously increasing the transparency of the MSU to the faculty.</p>
            <p>Stay informed of MSU plans before they are voted on, so that your voice, opinions and concerns are heard, ensuring that the SRA most accurately represents YOU. The SRA Engineering Facebook and Twitter pages are frequently updated with relevant info â€“ so follow us so that you can stay informed on any and all updates concerning anything MSU!</p>
